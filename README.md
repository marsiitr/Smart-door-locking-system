# Smart-door-locking-system

#### Open Project 2022

## Abstract

The main aim of this project is to open a Smart door lock from any where in the world by using IOT or by using Keypad.

## Motivation

To provide an easy and convenient method for unlocking a door by removing the need for thr old-fashioned key. And the time that is required to open the door using IOT is less than time required to open with normal key. And it also ensure more security for our lock.

## Components

* Nodemcu ESP 8266
* Arduino UNO
* Solenoid Lock Actuator
* Keypad
* 5V Single relay module
* 12V rechargeable Li-ion Battery
* 12V Charger
* Some diodes, Resistors, Connecting wires
* PCB designing

## Applications

This project has various applications in daily life. Now a days people are too busy and they want to make an advantage of resources in various aspects.
If you are having only one key to a house then the main problem here is other person of the house may not have the keys, so by using this IOT cloud  many people can access the door lock.
Disabled or elder people can easily access the door using their mobile phones.And it also ensures high security to the lock.

## Furter Improvements

* The circuit could be made compact by PCB printing. Also the casing can be done by printing the solid work model.
* LCD Display can be used to show the status of password, lock and other stuff.
* IOT code can be upgraded to store time of door opening in th cloud.
* The Lock can be integrated mechanically with modern door handle.
